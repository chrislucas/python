In python, a namespace is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently
implemented as Python dictionaries.
Examples of namespaces are: the set of built-in names (containing functions such as abs(), and
built-in exception names); the global names in a module, and the local names in a function invocation.
The impportant thing to know about namespaces is that there is abosolutely no relation
between names in different namespaces. For example, two modules may both define a function 'X'
without confusion
